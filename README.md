###Description  
This version of tic-tac-toe is pretty basic. X's go first, and you click on a cell to make your first.  You just follow the message on the screen until someone wins or a draw is made.  Where I am most proud of this game is hunder the hood, where my JS/jQuery is DRY, for my standards, and could be added onto once my skills increase.
